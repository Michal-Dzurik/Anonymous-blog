This project was created with React(JS) and Tailwind. It's simple blog where everyone can post something and everyone can see last 20 posts.

## To start the project
1. Download and extract project to your folder.
There you can see file **db_export.sql**, take it and import to your local database.

2. Go to **public/api/config.php** and change your DB information and start MySQL server
3. Go to **public/** and start php server with command
    ### `php -S localhost:80`

4. Go to your project root folder and run command  

    ### `npm start`

Now the project should be opened in your default browser, and you are now able to do what is project intended for. Enjoy
